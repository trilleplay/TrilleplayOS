Hello And Welcome to this brand new Android Open-Source OS.
For those of you who does not know what trilleplay do is that we make games.
I thought shoud there not be a Android OS With the power to Play Games in a diffrent way.
So TrilleplayOS is mainly going to be for game designers.
But that does not mean you can not be involved in the proccess of making this Android OS the best OS on the Planet :)
If you want to help us basicly you can compile the android source code more info on source.android.com and follow the instructions on how to compile the OS.

Also I would like to mention this is a fork of the Android Source Repo and they lisenced the Android Open Source Project with Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 Generic (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/) .
